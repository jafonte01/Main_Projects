Board game data organization by designer, mechanic, genre, which was NOT done for PREP capstone project:

#dfdesigner = []
#for row in df.designer:
#    if row != '(Uncredited)' or row != 'none':
#        dfdesigner.append(row)
#dfdesigner = df[(df.designer != '(' + 'Uncredited' + ')') | (df.designer != 'none')]
# Meh, at least I know I tried everything...

#dfdesigner = dfdesigner.groupby('designer').geek_rating.mean().reset_index()
#dfdesigner = dfdesigner.sort_values(by=['geek_rating'], ascending=False)
